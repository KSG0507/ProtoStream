# ProtoStream
Contains source code for the streaming algorithm

MNIST:
------
1. Run the file testSetClassificationAcc_WithSetSelection_MNIST.m with to generate the Accuracy and the Label Distribution Plots. If the code needs to be run anew, please set the parameter runCode in the first line to true (runCode = true) 
2. Run the file Streaming_timingPlotForDiffProtoSetSize.m to generate the timing plots. If the code needs to be run anew, please set the parameter runCode in the first line to true (runCode = true) 

Letters:
-------
1. Run the file testSetClassificationAcc_WithinSetSelection_UCI.m with to generate the Accuracy and the Label Distribution Plots. If the code needs to be run anew, please set the parameter runCode in the first line to true (runCode = true) 
2. Run the file Streaming_timingPlotForDiffProtoSetSize_UCI.m to generate the timing plots. If the code needs to be run anew, please set the parameter runCode in the first line to true (runCode = true)

USPS:
-----
1. Run the file testSetClassificationAcc_WithinSetSelection_USPS.m with to generate the Accuracy and the Label Distribution Plots. If the code needs to be run anew, please set the parameter runCode in the first line to true (runCode = true) 
2. Run the file Streaming_timingPlotForDiffProtoSetSize_USPS.m to generate the timing plots. If the code needs to be run anew, please set the parameter runCode in the first line to true (runCode = true)

Data:
-----
Both Letters and USPS data are provided in the zipped file.
Please download the MNIST data from "http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/" and save in the MNIST folder
