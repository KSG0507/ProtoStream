1. Run the file testSetClassificationAcc_WithSetSelection_MNIST.m with to generate the Accuracy and the Label Distribution Plots. If the code needs to be run anew, please set the parameter runCode in the first line to true (runCode = true) 
2. Run the file Streaming_timingPlotForDiffProtoSetSize.m to generate the timing plots. If the code needs to be run anew, please set the parameter runCode in the first line to true (runCode = true)
